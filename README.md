# trajtools

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of trajtools is to provide a place for people to discover,
explore, test and use open source tools for working with trajectory
data.

There are many existing tools for work with trajectories, writting in
various languages/frameworks, including the R packages
[trip](https://github.com/Trackage/trip), the Python package
[movingpandas](https://github.com/anitagraser/movingpandas) and the QGIS
Plugin
[trajectools](https://github.com/anitagraser/qgis-processing-trajectory).
However, there little in the way of cross-comparison, feature
comparison, or documentation that bridges the divide between different
trajectory packages, let alone languages.

This README will an introduction to trajectory data structures and
demonstrates how these have been implemented in various languages
(primarily R and Python).
